# My blog

These are the whole code and contents of my [blog](http://rangerer.at/), open
sourced. See the blogâ€™s [About](http://rangerer.at/about/) page for more
information.

Code, Templates and CSS are shamelessly copied from
[yggie49](https://github.com/yggi49)s
[obda.net](https://github.com/yggi49/obda.net) project and adapted for my
personal needs.


## Caveat

This code will only be maintained for my personal needs.
