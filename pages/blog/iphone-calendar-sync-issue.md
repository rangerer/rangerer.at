title: 'Iphone Calendar Sync Issue'

Today I found out that my iPhone wasn't syncing with
[Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar) any more.

Simple solution was to go into the Google Mail account on my iPhone and
de-activate Calendars and re-active them again. This seems to trigger a
complete new sync and I have all my appointments on my iPhone again.
