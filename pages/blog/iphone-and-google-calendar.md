title: 'iPhone and Google Calendar'

I'm a great fan of the combination iPhone and
[Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar). Its especially useful if
you share calendars with your wife - like I do.

Setup is rather straightforward - although I use Google Mail instead of
Exchange (suggested by Google) as the account type. That way I'm not able to
sync contacts (which I don't need to), but everything else works better. The
only difficult thing to figure out was how to activate multiple calendars for
your iPhone:

Simply go to <https://www.google.com/calendar/iphoneselect> on your iPhone
and select the calendars you want to sync. Some of your calenders (in my case
public ones) might not be available, but at least you will get all private and
shared ones.
